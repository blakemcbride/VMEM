This is a virtual memory system I wrote a number of years ago.  I used to
sell it and it works bug free as far as I know.  It was written and tested
in old K&R C instead of ANSI.  It has now been updated but not re-tested.
Also, now new, 64 bit machines are out.  The system has not been tested 
with 64 bit compilers.

VMEM is written in C and comes with a complete user and internals manual.
